# ðŸ§¨ The Problem
RTK Query **caches API responses**, and it **doesnâ€™t automatically clear cache** on logout or user change.
```plaintext
So when user A logs out and user B logs in, the UI may still show user Aâ€™s data â€” until the component re-fetches or you refresh manually.
```

# âœ… The Fix: Reset RTK Query Cache on Logout
## ðŸ‘‰ Step 1: Use the api.util.resetApiState() method from your API slice
You can dispatch this during logout to clear all cached queries.

## ðŸ§© Example (in authSlice or authActions.ts):
```ts
import { api } from "../services/api"; // your RTK query base API
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const authSlice = createSlice({
  name: "auth",
  initialState: { user: null },
  reducers: {
    logout: (state) => {
      state.user = null;
    },
  },
});

export const { logout } = authSlice.actions;

export const logoutAndReset = () => (dispatch: any) => {
  dispatch(logout());
  dispatch(api.util.resetApiState()); // âœ… clears RTK Query cache
};
```
Then call `logoutAndReset()` instead of just `logout()`.

# ðŸ§  Why This Works
`api.util.resetApiState()` is the official way to:

- Clear the entire query cache

- Cancel running queries

- Remove cached mutations and subscriptions

You usually want to call it when:

- The user logs out

- The access token changes

- A different user logs in

# âœ… Alternative (More Granular): Invalidate specific endpoints
If you donâ€™t want to reset all cache but just some parts, you can use:

dispatch(api.util.invalidateTags(['User', 'Profile']))
But for auth-related issues, a full reset is safer.

# âœ… Summary
| Problem                       | Fix                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Old userâ€™s data after logout  | `dispatch(api.util.resetApiState())` on logout |
| Redux store still holds cache | Use enhanced logout action (see above)         |
| Only updates on reload        | Because cache isnâ€™t invalidated                |
